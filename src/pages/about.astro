  <h1>About Master Azerbaijani</h1>

  <p>
    Hello everyone! I’m Shahla, a diaspora Azerbaijani and native speaker living abroad for the past
    13 years (my lucky number). For years, I wanted to teach my husband and kids Azerbaijani, but
    between work, parenting, and life in a new country, it just never happened. Along the way, I
    realized many families like mine face the same struggle: wanting to pass on language and
    heritage but not knowing where to start or how to fit it into daily life.
  </p>

  <p>
    During those years, I learned what really works (and what definitely doesn’t) when teaching a
    heritage language to busy adults and curious kids. I experimented with fun ways to make learning
    stick, discovered how to sneak vocabulary into everyday life, and figured out how tech can
    bridge the gap when real-time teaching isn’t possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why I finally built Master Azerbaijani: to make learning your heritage language simple,
    fun, and accessible for busy people living abroad. Interactive lessons, native pronunciation,
    and cultural context are all designed to help you connect with your roots and create lasting
    memories.
  </p>

  <p>
    This platform is built on real-life experience, not just theory. I know what it feels like to
    wish you could bridge generations, to want your kids to speak the language of their
    grandparents, and to feel the frustration when time and resources are limited.
  </p>

<p>
Professionally, I’ve spent years working in security, risk, and operations; skills that directly
shaped how I structure lessons, maintain quality, and build a learning experience that’s stable
and trustworthy. If you’re curious, you can see my full background on 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahla-mammadova-alyasiry/" target="_blank" style="color: #fc723b;">LinkedIn</a>.
</p>


  <p>
    To create a learning experience that feels polished, modern, and scalable, I expanded the project
    with a small set of specialized roles that support content structure, pronunciation quality,
    cultural accuracy, design, and overall learning flow. These roles help shape lessons, refine
    visuals, and ensure everything stays clear, intuitive, and true to the Azerbaijani language and
    culture.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, we’re building the platform I wish I had years ago: the one that helps families everywhere learn, connect, and belong.
