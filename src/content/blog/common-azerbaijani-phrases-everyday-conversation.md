## Your go-to starter kit for speaking like a real human, not a textbook.

If you’re learning Azerbaijani and you’re tired, overwhelmed, or just annoyed with the “repeat-after-me” apps that teach you how to say stuff like “The apple is red”… welcome. This is the blog post you actually need.

Because real conversations aren’t about impressing someone with perfect grammar. They’re about connection. Comfort. And not freezing up when someone asks you a basic question.

In other words: you need phrases you can use **today**, not after finishing Lesson 47.

This post gives you the most common everyday Azerbaijani phrases, the ones you’ll use constantly, whether you’re talking to your spouse, in-laws, friends, or the auntie who calls out of nowhere with zero warning.

And if you’re an Azerbaijani trying to help someone learn? These will keep you sane, too.

Let’s get into it.


## The Phrases Everyone Actually Uses

These are the heavy hitters: short, useful, and real. No fluff!


## Greetings & Basics

**Salam** [Sa-lam] | Hi / Hello  
- The “I don’t want to overthink it” greeting. Works everywhere.

**Necəsən?** [Ne-cə-sən] (informal) | How are you?
- **Necəsiniz?** [Ne-cə-si-niz] (formal) | How are you?  
- You’ll hear this 100 times a day. And you’ll use it just as much.

**Yaxşıyam** [Yax-şı-yam] | I’m good  
- Easy confidence boost for beginners.

**Sağ ol** [Sağ ol] (informal) | Goodbye
- **Sağ olun** [Sağ o-lun] (formal) | Goodbye  
- Simple, polite, and you’ll say it constantly.

You’re not done with “sağ ol” yet. It also means “thank you”: add “çox” and you’ll be saying “thank you very much” both informally (**çox sağ ol**) and formally (**çox sağ olun**).


## Getting to Know Someone

**Adın nədir?** [A-dın nə-dir] (informal) | What’s your name?
- **Adınız nədir?** [A-dı-nız nə-dir] (formal) | What’s your name?

**Mənim adım…** [Mə-nim a-dım...] | My name is…

**Haralısan?** [Ha-ra-lı-san] (informal) | Where are you from?
- **Haralısınız?** [Ha-ra-lı-sı-nız] (formal) | Where are you from?

These become second nature fast. Good for social situations or for when your mother-in-law introduces you to 12 relatives in one afternoon. **Someone will definitely ask you, guaranteed!**


## Everyday Must-Haves

**Zəhmət olmasa** [Zəh-mət ol-ma-sa] | Please  
- The magic word. Especially if you’re asking for water after multiple cups of tea.

**Təşəkkür edirəm** [Tə-şək-kür e-di-rəm] | Thank you  
- Or the “çox sağ ol” we’ve mentioned above.

If someone else tells you the “thank you” above, you can just say **Dəyməz** [Dəy-məz] as “you’re welcome”.

**Buyurun** [Bu-yu-run] | You’re welcome | Here you go  
- Very flexible word. Azerbaijanis love it. Use it everywhere.

**Bağışlayın** [Ba-ğış-la-yın] | Sorry | Excuse me  
- Works when you bump into someone, interrupt someone, or need them to repeat something… again.


## Conversation Lifesavers

**Başa düşmürəm** [Ba-şa düş-mü-rəm] | I don’t understand  
- Your #1 sentence for the first 3 months.

**Təkrar edə bilərsiniz?** [Tək-rar e-də bi-lər-si-niz] | Can you repeat?

**Yavaş danışa bilərsiniz?** [Ya-vaş da-nı-şa bi-lər-si-niz] | Can you speak slowly  
- The polite way to say: “I have no idea what you just said.”

**Başa düşdüm** [Ba-şa düş-düm] | I understood  
- **Başa düşürəm** [Ba-şa dü-şü-rəm] | I understand  

The moment this feels natural is the moment you know your brain is switching.


## But how do you remember these?

Because let’s be honest: reading them once won’t magically embed them.

Here’s what actually works in the real world.

### 1. Use them the moment you finish this blog  
- Say them out loud. Not in your head. Your brain needs the sound.  
- Even if you sound like a confused robot at first, it’s part of the process.

### 2. Attach them to routines  
- Going out the door? “Sağ ol.”  
- Making tea? “Buyurun.”  
- Calling someone? Start with “Salam.”  
- Language sticks when it’s tied to real life.

### 3. Speak Azerbaijani even if nobody answers you  
- Talk to yourself. It’s not weird. It’s efficient.

### 4. Mix in what you already know  
- If you’ve read my **[Azerbaijani Alphabet Made Easy](/blog/azerbaijani-alphabet-made-easy)**, then you already understand how these words should sound.  
- And if you liked the “active practice” part in **[5 Fun Ways to Learn Azerbaijani](/blog/learn-azerbaijani-without-textbooks-interactive-methods)**, these phrases are perfect to plug into those methods.

### 5. Stop translating! Start “thinking Azerbaijani”  
- If every single sentence goes through an English filter, you’ll get stuck.  
- These phrases are your first “ready-to-use” chunks that help flip that switch.

I have a full blog coming on this: **How to Think in Azerbaijani**, but this list is your warm-up.


## What to Expect When You Start Using These

Here’s the truth nobody tells you:

The first time you say **“Başa düşmürəm,”** you’ll feel shy.  
The fifth time, you’ll say it confidently.  
The tenth time, you won’t even think! It’ll just come out naturally.

This is where fluency starts, not with big grammar explanations, but with tiny victories in everyday conversations.

And if you’re someone reconnecting with your heritage language, these phrases are basically your “welcome home” kit. They unlock memories, emotions, and connections that English doesn’t quite reach.


## Final Thought

If you only memorize ten things in Azerbaijani this month, let it be these phrases.  
They’re simple, practical, and the backbone of every conversation, from small talk to deep talks.

**Your challenge before you close this tab:**  
Say **“salam”** to three people today, out loud!  
Even if one of them is your pet.
